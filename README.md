```

‚öôÔ∏è Create a .env file in the root of your project folder and configute it to look something like this
```yml
   PORT = 5000
   DATABASE_URL = postgres://postgres:password6@database_url/database_name
   MODE = DEV
   JWT_SECRET = "secret"
   CRYPT_KEY = "secret"
``` 


üíª Inside the folder, run the following command to install the dependencies.
